# Window Settings
Settings Window using WPF MVVM Pattern on .Net Core 3.1

• The numeric range of the slider can be set by 2 number input fields (minimum and maximum).

• The current value can be set by an additional number input field.

• The number input fields influence each other:
• The value cannot be outside minimum or maximum.
• If this rule is not fulfilled, the user should get a visual feedback (for example red text color or red outline of the number field).   

• A segmented control is used to switch the Rounding mode between an Integer or Double type as the number format of the fields minimum, maximum and value.

• Number of digits (if Double is selected) can be set in an additional input field (this will be disabled if Integer is selected).


# What I have covered!!
 Clean Architecture with DDD by TDD approach. 
 MVVM Pattern using WPF technology.  
 Material Design in XAML. 
 Custom Control for Number Slider.
 Dependency Injection and Entity Framework Core by using In Memory Database. 
 Restful API with .Net Core 3.1 (Asynchronous Programming). 
 Object Oriented Design with SOLID. 
 Entity Framework Core (Code First Approach). 
 Domain fit Design Patterns (e.g. Unit of Work, Generic Repository Pattern, and Builder Pattern). 
 Resource File (Storing Icon, Message, Images etc.).
